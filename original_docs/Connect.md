## Official project resources

### Gitter Chat Room
If you would like to text chat with the developers or other NVDA users directly, other than sending -emails, you may wish to join the [NVDA chat room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/nvaccess/NVDA). It is the chat room that has been set up for discussions of all issues related to NVDA. Also, you may share tips and personal stories about using NVDA, and you may ask relevant questions after reviewing the website and product documentation, or feel free to chat about more expected features and/or bug fixes.

If you prefer using IRC, you can also [connect to Gitter using an IRC client](https://irc.gitter.im/).
