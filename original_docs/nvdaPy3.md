This document outlines rationale and steps for moving NVDA from Python 2.7 to 3.7.

IMPORTANT: due to ongoing transition activities, this document is subject to change without notice.

## Background

Python is one of the popular programming languages for various projects. Its ease of learning, extensive standard library modules and third-party extensions, as well as extensive documentation and clear syntax makes it an ideal choice for scripting.

Currently there are two major branches of Python: 2.x, released in early 2000's, and 3.x, first released in 2008. At first glance, Python 3 may seem similar to Python 2, but there are numerous deeper differences which break backwards compatibility with code written for Python 2. These including extensive Unicode support in Python 3, module renames, changes to imports, changes to division, and many more.

## Rationale

When NVDA began in 2006, it used python 2.4. Over the years, NVDA and its add-ons were written in Python 2.7. Support for Python 2.7 is ending, it will no longer receive updates (performance, security, or bug fixes). For this reason, the longevity of NVDA depends on moving to Python 3.

## Getting started

Install Python 3.7 32-bit.

Note: as of December 2018, most add-ons won't work, so it is advised not to install any of them into the source code copy of NVDA unless you need to test your add-ons know the risks involved. The requirement to use Windows 10 has been lifted as eSpeak NG has been ported.

### Needed dependencies:

Most Python dependencies can be installed via PIP while running as a module in Python 3.7 like so:

`py -3 -m pip install dependencyName`

The above will work if Python Launcher is installed and the only Python 3 installed is 3.7 32-bit.

Before installing any dependencies listed below, be sure to install Python 3.7 32-bit. Dependencies marked "mandatory" must be installed.

* Python 3.7.x 32-bit (mandatory)
* Visual Studio 2017 (Community, Professional, Enterprise) (mandatory)
* Windows 10 SDK (build 17763) (mandatory)
* wxPython 4.0.3 for Python 3.7 (mandatory for GUI and other crucial subsystems)
* Six 1.11.0 (mandatory)
* SCons 3.0.1 (mandatory)
* comtypes 1.1.7 (mandatory)
* Pywin32 extensions build 223 for Python 3.7 (optional)
* pyserial for Python 3.7 (mandatory for debugging braille displays)
* Configobj 5.1.0 (mandatory)
* Any other dependencies advertising support for Python 2.x in one package or a separate release for Python 3.x

### Running Python 3 version of NVDA

Once Python 3.7 and dependencies are installed, provided that DLL's are compiled and the version of NVDA in source code form complies with Python 3, run the Python 3 NVDA from Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell as follows:

1. Change to the root directory of NVDA's source code.
2. Then type one of the following:
	* Only Python 3.7 32-bit is installed: `py -3 source/nvda.pyw`
	* Python 3.7 32-bit and 64-bit are installed: `py -3-32 source/nvda.pyw`
	* A different Python 3.x version is installed: `py -3.7-32 source/nvda.pyw`

### Debugging Python 3 transition work

There are two ways of debugging Python 3 transition workflow:

1. Post-mortem (NVDA crashes at startup or wish to view debug information at your leisure): read nvda.log located at "source" directory.
2. Interactive (testing an idea or find out how Python 3 modules work): Python Console can be used. Note that not all error messages will be printed to the console but can be found in the log.

## Transition workflow

The following is an overview of Python 2 to 3 transition for NVDA screen reader. Note that information below can change without notice.

### Notable issues and solutions:

* Renamed modules:
  - Examples:
    - `_winreg` -> `winreg`
    - `SocketServer` -> `socketserver`
    - `Queue` -> `queue`
  - For certain modules (especially those written in C), make sure new modules won't break functionality.
  - For at least one case (Espeak NG speech synthesizer), a Python module is imported but never used.
* Reorganized modules in Python 3:
  - Examples:
    - `urllib`
    - `io`
  - Try loading specific attributes from reorganized modules.
* Absolute versus relative imports:
  - Especially when aliasing is involved (using 'from moduleName import *", observed mostly in app modules).
  - Use relative imports of the form `from .moduleName import attributeName`
* Replacement of some private attributes of logging module.
  - These should be changed on a case-by-case basis.
* Inability to print a meaningful log text to log file.
  - Investigate streaming/file handler/redirection issue.
* Use of "async" in Python 3:
  - Which affects `nvwave.playWaveFile(async=True)` as this raises syntax error.
  - Rename the keyword to "asynchronous"
* Division differences (`/` versus `//`):
  - Examples:
    - `nvwave.WavePlayer`
    - manipulating mouse cursor.
  - Standardize around floor division (`//`) for integer values, regular division (`/`) for floats.
* Bytes versus strings:
  - caused by encoding, or in some cases, mandated by DLL's where ANSI characters are expected.
  - Try unifying under Unicode as much as possible.
  - This is pronounced when working with C functions (Espeak DLL, for example) where ANSI strings are expected by C functions but Python prefers Unicode.
* Removed and incompatible modules
  - EG:
    -  `new.instancemethod`
  - Either find a Python 3 equivalent, or use built-in Python features.
  - Same can be said about dependencies (`txt2tags`, for example)
* Provide `__hash__` method for classes implementing `__eq__` method 
  - EG:
    - `NVDAObjects.NVDAObject`
  - This is required due to hash randomization in python 3.3 and later.
  - One of the simplest solutions is to use the parent object's `__hash__` method (`__hash__ = parentClass.__hash__`).
* Object methods of the form `_get_property` do not work
  - EG when trying to set initial synthesizer, braille display, focus object
  - Caused by metaclass syntax differences between Python 2 and 3.
  - Use metaclass specifier of the form `metaclass=someclass`
  - Resolved in December 2018 (see below)
* Incompatible dictionary methods.
  - `dict.has_key(key)`: use `key in dict`
  - `dict.iter*`: use attributes directly (e.g. `dict.items()` instead of `dict.iteritems()`
  - Certain code fragments expect a list, so wrap the iterator call inside a list constructor
* No more `unichr`
  - Standardize around `chr`

### Before transition:

Start date: September 17, 2018

1. An NVDA version with wxPython 4 must be released. This is a must, as wxPython 4 supports Python 3, which is a stepping stone for Python 3 transition.
	* Requirement met on September 17, 2018 with release of NVDA 2018.3.
2. Source code level dependencies must be satisfied. This includes not only wxPython 4, but also ConfigObj, Comtypes, Pyserial, Pywin32 and others.
	* Requirement met on June 10, 2019.
3. Transition issues must be researched and documented (see above for known issues and proposed workarounds). Use "python 3" label.
	* As of July 13, 2019, at least 40 issues were identified, along with several pull requests, most of which are resolved.
4. If needed, create pull requests dealing with pre-transition workflow such as making NVDA source code Python 2 and 3 aware (imports, for instance).
	* As of july 13, 2019, at least 30 transition related pull request were submitted and merged into a staging branch.
5. Binary dependencies must be satisfied. These include wxPython, Py2exe and others.
	* Requirement met on June 10, 2019.
6. Tests must run to completion.
	* Requirement met on June 26, 2019.
7. Work must move from llimited testing to broad testing.
	* Requirement met on July 25, 2019.

Completed on: July 25, 2019

### Transition:

This is divided into two stages:

1. Stage 1 (source code changes): NVDA developers will investigate, provide fixes for, and test transition related issues.
2. Stage 2 (broad testing): testing beyond NVDA developers when NV Access believes transition work is ready for broad testing.

#### Stage 1: source code changes

Start date: June 8, 2019

1. A group of developers (code contributors, Python programmers outside of NVDA project and others) should work on transforming NVDA's source code to Python 3.
	* Do not run 2to3 and tell the script to replace files, as further tweaking is required for some files.
	* For each transformation iteration, test the source code to make sure features are identical (or almost identical) with older NVDA releases.
2. Issues related to transition must be documented.
	* Issues must be labeled as "Python 3" in GitHub.
	* If needed, proposed solutions and workarounds should be documented in the issue tracker.
3. Source code developers must test NVDA to make sure no major issues are encountered while working on python 3 transition. During this phase, binary builds will not be released until the below condition is met.
	* Gather dependencies and make sure they are compatible with Python 3.
	* Try running SCons under Python 3 to make sure source code is prepared.
	* If features are working, compare it against latest stable NVDA release in hopes of catching regressions.
4. A suitable binary distribution packager must be found, tested, and documented. A series of binary builds must be created to make sure the combination of NVDA's own python 3 code, dependencies, binary packagers, and others work seamlessly.
	* Originally, Py2exe was considered, but it does not support Python 3.7.
	* A promising alternative is cx_freeze.
	* A Python 3 version of Py2exe that supports Python 3.7 was found.
5. Appveyor build must finish to completion.
	* As of june 15, 2019, source code, launcher, and certain tests are working.
	* As of june 26, 2019, Appveyor build runs to completion.
6. Master branch must contain Python 3 work.
	* As of July 15, 2019, Python 3 work has moved from a staging branch to Project Threshold main branch.
	* As of July 25, 2019, Python 3 powers master branch.

Completed on: July 25, 2019

#### Stage 2: broad testing

Start date: July 25, 2019

1. Members of the public should be invited to test a series of try builds meant to test transition work, test add-ons, documentation purposes, community outreach and other steps.
2. Add-ons community and other stakeholders must be given guidance regarding Python 3 transition.
3. Add-on developers are asked to start porting their add-ons to Python 3.

Completed on: March 9, 2020

### After transition:

Start date: March 9, 2020

1. A beta of NVDA powered by python 3 must be released.
2. Members of the public should provide beta-level feedback.
3. Add-on developers are asked to provide notices regarding python 3 to users.
4. A stable version of NVDA powered by Python 3 is released.
5. Post-transition evaluation should take place, including documenting issues found during field testing, more community outreach and other activities.
6. If needed, attempts to use Python 3 native features should be attempted (see below for a list of possible features and their impact on NVDA).

Completed on: May 1, 2020

4. After transition: done.
5. Python 3 native features:
	* Asyncio: not important at this stage.
	* Collections.ChainMap: eases implementation of config.ConfigManager.
	* pyz: no impact unless use cases emerge.
	* Formatted string literals (the "f" strings): eases string debugging and more readable messages.
	* Gettext.pgettext (Python 3.8): long sought answer to message contexts (see GitHub issue 1524 for details).
	* Assignment expression (the ":=" operator in Python 3.8): may allow improved readability of some if and while statements.
	* sys.breakpointhook: allow Visual Studio debugger and friends to help debug NVDA (if installed).
	* Enum: may improve certain listings including roles list in control types.

## Notes for various audiences

### For code contributors:

* Document potential and actual issues when working with Python 3, including changed modules, attribute name changes, internal changes and so on.
* When importing a built-in Python module, use try/except when importing modules.
	* Try importing Python 2 names as Python 3 name, switching to Python 3 version when Python 2 module is not found or renamed.
	* See NVDA source code for implementation steps.
	* This is for work prior to transition. During transition, Python 3 import should be attempted first.
* Issues should be labeled as "python 3".
* Pull requests should be based on master branch unless specified by lead developers.
* Try using branch name of the form "py3*" where "*" denotes Python 3 feature e.g. py3socketserver for changes to socket server module.
* If working with built-in Python modules, be sure to test your code via Python 2.7 and 3.7 interpreter before making changes to NVDA source code.
	* Create a standalone script that'll use features from Python 2 and/or 3.
	* After testing this script and if it works in Python 3, make changes to NVDA source code and add comments regarding differences between Python 2 and 3.
	* Source code should target both Python 2 and 3 unless the pull request is submitted during active transition period.
* Edit this page whenever major changes are committed to master branch or pull request is merged, including import changes and such.

### For add-on developers:

* Try using Python modules that are known to be compatible with both Python 2 and 3.
* Be sure to test add-ons in 2019.3 alpha and edit add-on files accordingly.
* Make sure to communicate status of Python 3 compatibility for add-ons if possible.

### For testers:

* Use a portable copy of 2019.3 alpha if you rely on add-ons not ported to Python 3 yet.
* Contact add-on authors if add-ons do not work in 2019.3 alpha.

### For translators:

Nothing yet.

### For users:

nothing yet.

### For organizations:

* Stay informed on Python 3 transition workflow.

### For Python community:

* During pre-transition period, please help NVDA project spot potential issues with Python 3 transition so they can be noted.
* During transition, please help write and test Python 3 code and provide additional comments.
* During post-transition, please help NV Access review transition work, as well as suggest Python 3 features NVDA should adopt,
