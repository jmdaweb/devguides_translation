_(u"""NOTE: as of 2021, this document is part of the wiki for historical reasons and to serve as a reference for Python upgrades."""),
"",_(u"""This document outlines rationale and steps for moving NVDA from Python 2.7 to 3.7."""),
"",_(u"""## Background"""),
"",_(u"""Python is one of the popular programming languages for various projects. Its ease of learning, extensive standard library modules and third-party extensions, as well as extensive documentation and clear syntax makes it an ideal choice for scripting."""),
"",_(u"""Currently there are two major branches of Python: 2.x, released in early 2000's, and 3.x, first released in 2008. At first glance, Python 3 may seem similar to Python 2, but there are numerous deeper differences which break backwards compatibility with code written for Python 2. These including extensive Unicode support in Python 3, module renames, changes to imports, changes to division, and many more."""),
"",_(u"""## Rationale"""),
"",_(u"""When NVDA began in 2006, it used python 2.4. Over the years, NVDA and its add-ons were written in Python 2.7. Support for Python 2.7 is ending, it will no longer receive updates (performance, security, or bug fixes). For this reason, the longevity of NVDA depends on moving to Python 3."""),
"",_(u"""## Getting started"""),
"",_(u"""Learn more about differences between Python 2 and 3, some resources:"""),

_(u"""- http://python3porting.com/"""),
_(u"""- http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html"""),
"",_(u"""Install Python 3.7 32-bit."""),
"",_(u"""### Needed dependencies:"""),
"",_(u"""Most Python dependencies can be installed via PIP while running as a module in Python 3.7 like so:"""),
"",_(u"""`py -3 -m pip install dependencyName`"""),
"",_(u"""The above will work if Python Launcher is installed and the only Python 3 installed is 3.7 32-bit."""),
"",_(u"""Before installing any dependencies listed below, be sure to install Python 3.7 32-bit. Dependencies marked \"mandatory\" must be installed."""),
"",_(u"""* Python 3.7.x 32-bit (mandatory)"""),
_(u"""* Visual Studio 2017 (Community, Professional, Enterprise) (mandatory)"""),
_(u"""* Windows 10 SDK (build 17763) (mandatory)"""),
_(u"""* wxPython 4.0.3 for Python 3.7 (mandatory for GUI and other crucial subsystems)"""),
_(u"""* Six 1.11.0 (mandatory)"""),
_(u"""* SCons 3.0.1 (mandatory)"""),
_(u"""* comtypes 1.1.7 (mandatory)"""),
_(u"""* Pywin32 extensions build 223 for Python 3.7 (optional)"""),
_(u"""* pyserial for Python 3.7 (mandatory for debugging braille displays)"""),
_(u"""* Configobj 5.1.0 (mandatory)"""),
_(u"""* Any other dependencies advertising support for Python 2.x in one package or a separate release for Python 3.x"""),
"",_(u"""### Running Python 3 version of NVDA"""),
"",_(u"""Once Python 3.7 and dependencies are installed, provided that DLL's are compiled and the version of NVDA in source code form complies with Python 3, run the Python 3 NVDA from Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell as follows:"""),
"",_(u"""1. Change to the root directory of NVDA's source code."""),
_(u"""2. Then type one of the following:"""),
_(u"""	* Only Python 3.7 32-bit is installed: `py -3 source/nvda.pyw`"""),
_(u"""	* Python 3.7 32-bit and 64-bit are installed: `py -3-32 source/nvda.pyw`"""),
_(u"""	* A different Python 3.x version is installed: `py -3.7-32 source/nvda.pyw`"""),
"",_(u"""### Debugging Python 3 transition work"""),
"",_(u"""There are two ways of debugging Python 3 transition workflow:"""),
"",_(u"""1. Post-mortem (NVDA crashes at startup or wish to view debug information at your leisure): read nvda.log located at \"source\" directory."""),
_(u"""2. Interactive (testing an idea or find out how Python 3 modules work): Python Console can be used. Note that not all error messages will be printed to the console but can be found in the log."""),
"",_(u"""## Transition workflow"""),
"",_(u"""The following is an overview of Python 2 to 3 transition for NVDA screen reader. Note that information below can change without notice."""),
"",_(u"""### Notable issues and solutions:"""),
"",_(u"""* Renamed modules:"""),
_(u"""  - Examples:"""),
_(u"""    - `_winreg` -> `winreg`"""),
_(u"""    - `SocketServer` -> `socketserver`"""),
_(u"""    - `Queue` -> `queue`"""),
_(u"""  - For certain modules (especially those written in C), make sure new modules won't break functionality."""),
_(u"""  - For at least one case (Espeak NG speech synthesizer), a Python module is imported but never used."""),
_(u"""* Reorganized modules in Python 3:"""),
_(u"""  - Examples:"""),
_(u"""    - `urllib`"""),
_(u"""    - `io`"""),
_(u"""  - Try loading specific attributes from reorganized modules."""),
_(u"""* Absolute versus relative imports:"""),
_(u"""  - Especially when aliasing is involved (using 'from moduleName import *\", observed mostly in app modules)."""),
_(u"""  - Use relative imports of the form `from .moduleName import attributeName`"""),
_(u"""* Replacement of some private attributes of logging module."""),
_(u"""  - These should be changed on a case-by-case basis."""),
_(u"""* Inability to print a meaningful log text to log file."""),
_(u"""  - Investigate streaming/file handler/redirection issue."""),
_(u"""* Use of \"async\" in Python 3:"""),
_(u"""  - Which affects `nvwave.playWaveFile(async=True)` as this raises syntax error."""),
_(u"""  - Rename the keyword to \"asynchronous\""""),
_(u"""* Division differences (`/` versus `//`):"""),
_(u"""  - Examples:"""),
_(u"""    - `nvwave.WavePlayer`"""),
_(u"""    - manipulating mouse cursor."""),
_(u"""  - Standardize around floor division (`//`) for integer values, regular division (`/`) for floats."""),
_(u"""* Bytes versus strings:"""),
_(u"""  - caused by encoding, or in some cases, mandated by DLL's where ANSI characters are expected."""),
_(u"""  - Try unifying under Unicode as much as possible."""),
_(u"""  - This is pronounced when working with C functions (Espeak DLL, for example) where ANSI strings are expected by C functions but Python prefers Unicode."""),
_(u"""* Removed and incompatible modules"""),
_(u"""  - EG:"""),
_(u"""    -  `new.instancemethod`"""),
_(u"""  - Either find a Python 3 equivalent, or use built-in Python features."""),
_(u"""  - Same can be said about dependencies (`txt2tags`, for example)"""),
_(u"""* Provide `__hash__` method for classes implementing `__eq__` method """),
_(u"""  - EG:"""),
_(u"""    - `NVDAObjects.NVDAObject`"""),
_(u"""  - This is required due to hash randomization in python 3.3 and later."""),
_(u"""  - One of the simplest solutions is to use the parent object's `__hash__` method (`__hash__ = parentClass.__hash__`)."""),
_(u"""* Object methods of the form `_get_property` do not work"""),
_(u"""  - EG when trying to set initial synthesizer, braille display, focus object"""),
_(u"""  - Caused by metaclass syntax differences between Python 2 and 3."""),
_(u"""  - Use metaclass specifier of the form `metaclass=someclass`"""),
_(u"""  - Resolved in December 2018 (see below)"""),
_(u"""* Incompatible dictionary methods."""),
_(u"""  - `dict.has_key(key)`: use `key in dict`"""),
_(u"""  - `dict.iter*`: use attributes directly (e.g. `dict.items()` instead of `dict.iteritems()`"""),
_(u"""  - Certain code fragments expect a list, so wrap the iterator call inside a list constructor"""),
_(u"""* No more `unichr`"""),
_(u"""  - Standardize around `chr`"""),
